An Android Application developed using Java that displays a list of top tech news articles from around the world and redirects to their website by clicking on them.

It uses the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) API to extract the news articles and stores them in an [SQLiteDatabase](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase).
